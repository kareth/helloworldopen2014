* Big throttle scheduler comparison:
    - all maps/schedulers
    - best lap ticks, sum ticks for 3 laps, max comp. time, avg comp. time 
    - x,a,v,d,dir,rad,turbo table for each map/scheduler.

* Which horizon is enough?
    - check more horizon settings (what about after-horizon?)
    - perf: 

* rradius = last rradius instead of 10 hardcoded in curves
* use should not use MagicScheduler before model is ready (i.e. getting future schedule)

* WojtekThrottleScheduler:
    - idea: only 4 changes
    - first node can change with step 0.1
    - in each node consider 0, 1. If 1 is too much than consider something less than 1, maximizing future angle (with all other throttles set to 0; binary search for feasibility).
    - time limit, return currently best on time
    - idea: 111111000 is always better than some other combination of 7 1' and 3 0'

* Solver:
    - check if on Keimodo there are no errors

* Solver upgrades:
    - Solver improve only if new is better than the older
    - accept turbo

* Solver performance:
    - make it do not treat a as variable
    - add initial solution
    - add bounds on the result
    - add max. time
    - better handle after-horizon safety
    - check whether directly computing d improves performance
    - tuner
